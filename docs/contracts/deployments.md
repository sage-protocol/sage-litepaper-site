## Verifying Contract Addresses

You can verify these addresses and view contract source code on [Basescan](https://basescan.org):

```bash
# Using the Sage CLI
sage contract verify --network base-sepolia --address <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

# Or manually on Basescan
# 1. Navigate to https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/<ADDRESS>
# 2. Click "Contract" tab
# 3. View verified source code and ABI
```

---

## Subgraph Endpoints

The Sage subgraph indexes all on-chain events for fast querying:

### Base Sepolia

```
GraphQL Endpoint: (To be deployed)
Queries/day: Unlimited (development)
```

Example query:

```graphql
query LatestLibraries {
  libraries(
    first: 10
    orderBy: updatedAt
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    id
    name
    manifestCid
    subdao {
      name
      governor
    }
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

### Base Mainnet

```
GraphQL Endpoint: (Coming after mainnet launch)
```

---

## IPFS Infrastructure

### Public Gateways

Primary gateway for content retrieval:

- **Gateway URL**: https://gateway.sageprotocol.io
- **Managed Worker**: https://ipfs-worker.sageprotocol.io
- **Fallback Gateway**: https://w3s.link/ipfs/

### Pinning Services

Sage uses a managed Cloudflare Worker for pinning with credit-based payment:

- **Worker Endpoint**: https://ipfs-worker.sageprotocol.io
- **Credit Purchase**: Via CLI (`sage ipfs buy-credits`)
- **Pricing**: ~$0.01-0.10 per GB/month

---

## CLI Configuration

To configure the Sage CLI to use these addresses:

```bash
# Connect to Base Sepolia testnet
sage config set --network base-sepolia

# Verify connection
sage config show

# Output:
# Network: base-sepolia
# RPC: https://sepolia.base.org
# Factory: 0x23EaCE10fdFe526E80301dD1E9535e4B14aECb34
# Library Registry: 0x2d508622C9daE1BfFD984Ad92EE002e50819A241

## Treasury Addresses

### Main Protocol Treasury

- **Safe Address**: (To be deployed on mainnet)
- **Signers**: 5-of-9 multisig (core team, advisors, community)
- **Holdings**: SAGE, USDC, ETH
- **LaunchGate**: (To be deployed)
- **TreasuryWrapper**: (To be deployed)

### Example SubDAO Treasuries

SubDAOs create their own treasuries during deployment. View all SubDAOs:

```bash
sage subdao list --network base-sepolia
```

---

## Contract ABIs

All contract ABIs are available in the monorepo:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/velinusplatform/sage-protocol
cd sage-protocol

# ABIs are in packages/contracts/artifacts
ls packages/contracts/artifacts/contracts/
```

Or fetch via CLI:

```bash
sage contract abi --name SubDAOFactory --output factory-abi.json
```

---

## Security & Audits

All contracts have undergone professional security audits:

- **Cyfrin**: [View Report](https://github.com/sageprotocol/audits/cyfrin-2024.pdf)
- **OpenZeppelin**: [View Report](https://github.com/sageprotocol/audits/oz-2024.pdf)

**Bug Bounty Program**: Up to $50,000 USDC for critical vulnerabilities. See [bug bounty details](https://github.com/sageprotocol/security).

---

## Latest Addresses

Deployment addresses are automatically updated after each deployment. For the absolute latest addresses, check:

```bash
# Via CLI
sage contract list --network base-sepolia --latest

# Or view in docs
cat docs/appendix/addresses.latest.md
```

**Note**: Always verify contract addresses through multiple sources before interacting with them. Never trust addresses from unofficial sources.

---

## Contract Upgrades

Sage uses a combination of upgradeable and immutable contracts:

### Immutable Contracts

- SXXX Token (ERC20Votes)
- Library Registry
- Timelock implementations

### Upgradeable Contracts (via Governance)

- SubDAO Factory (Diamond proxy pattern)
- Governor implementations (via Timelock)
- Treasury system (LaunchGate, TreasuryWrapper)

All upgrades require:
1. Governance proposal
2. Community vote
3. Timelock delay (≥24 hours on mainnet)
4. Multi-signature approval (for critical contracts)
