# Economic Thesis: Prompts as Governed Capital

Sage’s core claim is economic, not just technical:

- **Prompts create leverage** (they turn general models into repeatable work).
- **Prompts decay** (models change, tools change, edge cases accumulate, and “what worked” silently stops working).
- The highest-value work isn’t writing a prompt once — it’s **keeping a prompt aligned over time**.

Sage turns that ongoing maintenance into an investable and governable process.

## The Problem: Prompt Decay Creates Unpriced Risk

Most prompts live in private chat logs and “copy‑paste lore.” That creates three failure modes:

- **No canonical version**: teams don’t know which prompt is “the real one.”
- **No maintenance market**: improvements are ad hoc; nobody is paid to fix edge cases.
- **No provenance**: it’s hard to trust why a change happened, who approved it, and what it replaced.

The result is a hidden tax: your best prompts degrade into brittle folklore.

## The Claim: Governance Is an “Acceptance Function” for Prompts

Sage treats a prompt library like a living product:

- **IPFS + manifests** make the library content durable and addressable.
- **Governance** decides what changes become canonical, and when.
- **On-chain provenance** makes adoption legible: who proposed, who approved, what executed.

This is how prompts align over time: not by freezing them, but by giving communities a repeatable way to evolve them.

## The New Labor Market: Maintainership for Humans and Agents

Sage creates a new class of work:

- Find prompt failures in the wild (edge cases, model drift, policy drift).
- Propose improvements and variants.
- Review and merge changes with the right authority (solo, council, or token holders).
- Earn based on impact (bounties, premium sales, reputation-weighted influence).

Crucially, this market is **agent-native**: agents can discover governed prompts, draft improvements, and submit work for human/governance approval.

## What the Token *Does* (Sage Token / SXXX)

Sage’s token is a coordination primitive. It is used to:

- **Allocate attention**: delegation and voting turn “this should be improved” into an explicit decision process.
- **Fund work**: bounties pay contributors for concrete upgrades.
- **Reward participation**: boosts can pay voters on high‑stakes proposals to raise turnout.
- **Tie influence to contribution**: voting multipliers let communities weight long-term contributors more than pure capital.
- **Price premium value**: premium prompts monetize expertise directly (with protocol/DAO revenue splits depending on the model).

The point is not “token = hype.” The point is **token = mechanism design for maintenance**.

## The Flywheel

When it works, Sage is a compounding loop:

1) Better prompts → more usage (by humans + agents)  
2) More usage → more edge cases + clearer demand for fixes  
3) Clear demand + budgets → more contributors and better updates  
4) Governance acceptance → higher trust + discoverability  
5) Higher trust → more usage

This loop is the economic bet: prompt quality can compound when incentives and legitimacy are structured.

## What Exists Today vs. What’s Still Evolving

Today, the core mechanisms are live:

- Governed library updates (manifest CID changes)
- Bounties + (optional) soulbound badges
- Voting multipliers + auctions
- Premium prompts (personal model)
- Agent-first discovery and publishing via CLI + MCP

Some adjacent systems are still evolving:

- DAO-level premium endorsement and revenue splits (roadmap)
- Credit-based paid pinning (experimental worker + credits ledger)
- Ongoing simplification of “source of truth” for library views as bounty flows mature

This document focuses on framing the thesis; see the [Tooling & Surfaces](tooling-and-surfaces.md) page for how the pieces fit together in practice.
