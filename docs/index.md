> ### The first permissionless protocol for incentivized agent context sharing.

Sage is a protocol for community‚Äëowned prompt libraries. Publish once to **IPFS**, govern upgrades through your SubDAO, and let agents automatically discover the best approved version. As libraries improve, rewards flow back to the people who make them useful. Follow the founder [@VelinusSage](https://x.com/VelinusSage) for updates.

## Why Now?

AI moves fast; community memory doesn‚Äôt. Prompts and context end up in scattered docs, chats, and private repos. As models change, good patterns go stale. There‚Äôs no portable way to store, version, and improve shared context, or to credit and reward the people who advance it. Sage solves four problems:

1.  **No Shared Source of Truth**  
    Everyone works from copies; there‚Äôs no trusted, up‚Äëto‚Äëdate version with history.

2.  **Prompt Decay**  
    Models evolve weekly. Yesterday‚Äôs best pattern quietly breaks, and the update doesn‚Äôt reach everyone. Communities need a place to vote, fork, and ship updates together.

3.  **No Attribution by Default**  
    Reuse happens without provenance or revenue share, so creators aren‚Äôt rewarded.

4.  **No Sustainable Funding Loop**  
    Communities lack an easy way to pool funds, pay contributors, and reinvest wins so improvements compound over time.

> Sage exists to make community knowledge durable, discoverable, and rewarded.

## What Sage Is

Sage is a protocol that lets communities publish prompt libraries on **IPFS**, register them on-chain, and govern upgrades through their own **SubDAO**. A manifest file defines an entire library, and one proposal updates the whole set. Discoverability runs through a subgraph and an **MCP** server so agents can search and pull context directly. Interfaces include a **CLI**, a web app, and Model Context Protocol (**MCP**) endpoints for agent tooling like Claude Desktop.

-   **Publish**: Push a manifest and prompt files to **IPFS**. Get immutable CIDs.
-   **Propose**: Each manifest is one governance proposal in your **SubDAO**. Vote, queue, and execute through a Timelock.
-   **Discover**: Agents, the **CLI**, and the web app read via subgraph first and fall back to RPC.
-   **Use**: **MCP** tools return content by CID so agents can load context on demand.

This approach gives AI artists, prompt engineers, and research groups an easy path to share and store their working prompts with permanence, version history, and clear community ownership.

---

## What Makes It Different

-   **Community First**  
    Each community has a **SubDAO** with its own library, governance, and treasury. Forks and remixing are explicit, not implicit. Curation happens in public.

-   **Manifest‚ÄëFirst Upgrades**  
    Ship atomic updates to entire collections. That cuts gas, reduces proposal fatigue, and keeps libraries coherent.

-   **Incentives Built-In**  
    **Boosts** reward participation. **Bounties** pay for new prompts. **Premiums** let creators sell encrypted content with on-chain receipts. Proceeds route to **SubDAO** and protocol treasuries.

-   **AI-Assisted Authoring**: A built-in CLI agent helps you write new prompts from scratch. Use `sage prompt generate` to turn a simple topic into a structured, high-quality prompt file, ready for use and curation.

-   **Agent‚ÄëNative Discovery**  
    An **MCP** server exposes search, fetch, and manifest validation. Agents can query libraries directly, then pull the exact context they need.

-   **Production on Base**  
    Contracts, subgraph, and flows run on Base Sepolia today, designed to graduate to Base mainnet following a gated launch sequence.

## The Self‚ÄëImproving Metaprompting Loop

1.  **Publish**  
    Authors push a library with a human‚Äëreadable manifest. **IPFS** CIDs anchor content.

2.  **Curate**  
    The community proposes variants, votes, and executes upgrades. Approver Councils can be badge‚Äëgated for fast tracks when needed.

3.  **Reward**  
    **Boosts** pay voters or contributors for specific decisions. **Bounties** fund new prompts. **Premiums** monetize high‚Äëeffort work. Treasury routes and override guards are set by governance.

4.  **Use and Measure**  
    Agents fetch context via **MCP**. Communities gauge a prompt's value through on-chain signals like forks, bounty completions, and governance proposals, creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

---

## Core Components

-   **Smart Contracts on Base**  
    **SubDAO** Factory, Governor and Timelock, LibraryRegistry, PromptRegistry, Treasury modules, optional **LBP** and **Bonding** integrations.

-   **Storage and Discovery**  
    **IPFS** for payloads, subgraph‚Äëfirst reads across **CLI**, web, and **MCP**.

-   **Tooling**  
    A complete **CLI**, a web app for discovery and drafting, and an **MCP** stdio server that plugs into Claude Desktop or an HTTP server for other agents.

---

## Technical Overview

At a high level, Sage combines three familiar building blocks:

-   On‚Äëchain governance (Governor + Timelock) for trusted upgrades
-   IPFS for content and manifests with immutable CIDs
-   An index layer (subgraph + MCP) for search and agent access

Updates are ‚Äúmanifest‚Äëfirst‚Äù: one proposal approves a new manifest CID and atomically updates the entire library. Agents read the subgraph first and fall back to RPC, so they always see the latest approved version.

---

## Incentives and Ownership

Sage powers three on‚Äëchain incentive rails that communities can combine.

### 1. Boosts

Parameterizable rewards for governance participation or contributor actions. Two manager contracts exist:

-   Direct manager for per‚Äëvoter payouts tied to a proposal.
-   Merkle manager for pooled funding and claim‚Äëby‚Äëproof.

Both paths are governed through the **SubDAO** Timelock. The **CLI** supports `create`, `fund`, `set-root`, `status`, `claim`, and `finalize`.

### 2. Bounties

Announce tasks, award winners, and pay out from the Timelock. This system is event-only by design. Fund the Timelock with ETH or an ERC‚Äë20 before executing payout proposals.

### 3. Premium Prompts

Encrypt content client-side, pin to **IPFS**, and gate decryption with Lit v7 and ERC‚Äë1155 receipts. Buyers pay in USDC, get a receipt NFT, and decrypt locally with session signatures. Pricing and treasury routing are on‚Äëchain. No reveal server is needed.

### Paid Pinning Revenue

When libraries are pushed with paid pinning, the service receives USDC and calls on-chain attribution. The default split routes 80% to the **SubDAO** treasury and 20% to the protocol treasury.

In production, an HTTP‚Äënative payment flow (x402) can collect USDC at request time and attribute proceeds automatically. For communities, this means: pay once to persist content; revenue lands transparently in your treasury.

### SBTs and Badge‚ÄëGated Fast Tracks

Non‚Äëtransferable **SBTs** recognize contributors and can gate Approver Council permissions to move quickly on scoped updates, with function selectors allow‚Äëlisted by governance.

---

## Governance Modes (Simple)

Communities can start simple and evolve their governance shape over time:

-   Bootstrap: member list with proposal cooldowns and refundable deposits to prevent spam.
-   Token: standard ERC20Votes quorum using SAGE or a SubDAO stake token.
-   Operator: trusted multisig or owner executes via Timelock for fast iteration.

The CLI can plan/apply role changes safely through proposals or Safe transactions.

---

## For Communities

-   **AI Artists and Prompt Engineers**  
    Store prompts permanently with **IPFS** CIDs, track versions, and get discovery out of the box. Add premium entries when you want to sell high‚Äëeffort sets.

-   **Research Groups and Guilds**  
    Use **Bounties** for new methods, **Boosts** for review cycles, and **SBTs** for reputation. Fork libraries when styles or standards diverge.

-   **Agent Builders**  
    Query the subgraph or **MCP** to pull the latest approved context and keep agents in sync as libraries evolve.

---

## Why Base

Base is where on-chain apps have grown fastest this cycle, with significant TVL and a culture of shipping public goods. Aerodrome has become the liquidity hub for Base, with community emissions and LP tooling that many projects model against. Projects launching on Base often use Fjord‚Äôs **LBPs** to align distribution with community discovery. Sage follows these patterns for its treasury and launch readiness.

In plain terms: Base keeps fees low, is OP‚ÄëStack compatible, and has the most active community for AI‚Äëadjacent projects today. That means cheaper governance, faster experiments, and better discovery for new libraries.

---

## Security and Launch Status

-   **Security Model**  
    All writes flow through a Governor to a Timelock. Emergency pause, least-privilege roles, and upgrade paths are governance-controlled.

-   **Testnet Readiness**  
    Fully working end-to-end on Base Sepolia, including library updates, governance, treasury demos, **MCP**, and the app.

-   **Audits & Reviews**: Contracts follow standard OZ Governor/Timelock patterns; external audits and public review precede mainnet.
-   **Role Boundaries**: Sensitive actions route through the Timelock; council modules can allowlist function selectors for scoped, badge‚Äëgated fast tracks.
-   **Operational Hygiene**: Default timelock delays, proposal cooldowns, and per‚Äëaddress caps reduce spam and operational risk during bootstrap.

---

## Token and Treasury, in Plain Terms

The Sage economy provides three distinct pillars for a self-sustaining ecosystem:

1.  **Treasury Growth:** The protocol's main treasury is funded by a one-time **LBP** launch and ongoing **bond** sales. This ensures the long-term financial health and stability of the `SAGE` token.
2.  **Creator Rewards:** **SubDAOs** receive grants from the main treasury and use those funds to post **bounties**. This creates a direct, work-to-earn loop for prompt engineers and other contributors.
3.  **Community Governance:** `SAGE` token holders stake their tokens in **SubDAOs** to vote on content curation and community decisions, ensuring that the most valuable context is promoted and rewarded.

-   **Fixed Supply**: SAGE targets a fixed 1B supply at genesis with deflationary burns tied to creation/forking where appropriate. No inflation.
-   **Treasury Bootstrapping**: A public **LBP** plus optional bond sales seed protocol‚Äëowned liquidity and long‚Äëterm reserves; SubDAOs may receive grants.
-   **Coordination over Fees**: Tokens primarily coordinate long‚Äëhorizon work (governance, reputation, commitment burns) rather than charging per‚Äëprompt usage.

## From On-Chain to IDE: The Power of the CLI

Beyond governance, the Sage **CLI** is a powerful bridge between the decentralized protocol and your local development environment. It's designed to pull complex, on-chain agent systems directly into your workflow and format them for professional IDEs.

With a single command, `sage context pull`, you can parse an entire **SubDAO**'s curated library and generate ready-to-use local files for specific editing environments:

-   **For Cursor:** Generate a `.cursorrules` file, allowing you to reference the entire on-chain library directly within the Cursor IDE.
-   **For Windsurf:** Generate a `.windsurf/context.md` file, providing structured context for agentic development in Windsurf.

This makes decentralized curation a practical, daily tool inside your IDE.
