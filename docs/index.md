# What is Sage?

Sage helps you build and share prompt libraries with others. Whether you're working alone, with a team, or building a community—Sage handles versioning, collaboration, and distribution so you can focus on writing great prompts.

## What You Can Do

### Publish Your Work

Stop losing prompts in chat histories. Publish them to a library where you (and others) can find, use, and improve them.

```bash
sage prompts init           # Create a workspace
# Write prompts in prompts/
sage project push           # Publish to your library
```

Your prompts get versioned automatically. Every change is tracked. You can always roll back.

### Iterate With Others

The best prompts come from iteration. Sage makes it easy to collaborate:

- **Get feedback**: Share your library. Others can try your prompts and suggest improvements.
- **Accept contributions**: When someone submits a better version, review and merge it.
- **Track attribution**: Every contributor gets credit. The history shows who improved what.

### Build a Community

As your library grows, you might want others to help maintain it:

**Start with a team**: Invite 2-3 collaborators. Changes require approval from multiple people before going live.

**Open it up**: Let anyone propose improvements. Your community votes on which changes get adopted.

**Incentivize contributions**: Post bounties for specific improvements. "Make the SQL prompt handle edge cases better" → someone fixes it → they get paid.
