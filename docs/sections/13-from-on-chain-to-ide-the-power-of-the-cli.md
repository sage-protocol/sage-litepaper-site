# From On-Chain to IDE: The Power of the CLI

Beyond governance, the Sage **CLI** is a powerful bridge between the decentralized protocol and your local development environment. It's designed to pull complex, on-chain agent systems directly into your workflow and format them for professional IDEs.

With a single command, `sage context pull`, you can parse an entire **SubDAO**'s curated library and generate ready-to-use local files for specific editing environments:

-   **For Cursor:** Generate a `.cursorrules` file, allowing you to reference the entire on-chain library directly within the Cursor IDE.
-   **For Windsurf:** Generate a `.windsurf/context.md` file, providing structured context for agentic development in Windsurf.

This makes decentralized curation a practical, daily tool inside your IDE.
