# From On-Chain to On-Device: The Power of the CLI

Beyond governance, the Sage **CLI** is a powerful bridge between the decentralized protocol and local development. It's designed to pull complex, on-chain agent systems directly into your workflow.

With a single command, you can parse an entire **SubDAO**'s curated library and generate ready-to-use local files:

-   **For Custom GPTs:** Generate a `system-prompt.txt` file, perfectly formatted for use in OpenAI's GPT builder.
-   **For Coding Agents:** Output a series of `.js` or `.py` files, where each file contains a specific prompt for a step in your automated coding workflow.
-   **For AI Art:** Create a JSON file of tested, high-quality prompts formatted for the Midjourney or Stable Diffusion API.

This transforms decentralized curation into a practical, daily tool for developers and creators.
