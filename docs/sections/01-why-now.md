# Why Now?

AI moves fast; community memory doesn’t. Prompts and context end up in scattered docs, chats, and private repos. As models change, good patterns go stale. There’s no portable way to store, version, and improve shared context, or to credit and reward the people who advance it. Sage fixes four blockers:

1.  **No Shared Source of Truth**  
    Everyone works from copies; there’s no trusted, up‑to‑date version with history.

2.  **Prompt Decay**  
    Models evolve weekly. Yesterday’s best pattern quietly breaks, and no one sees the diff or the fix land in time. Communities need a place to vote, fork, and ship updates together.

3.  **No Attribution by Default**  
    Reuse happens without provenance or revenue share, so creators aren’t rewarded.

4.  **Missing Treasury Loop**  
    There’s no clean way to fund curation, pay contributors, and compound gains inside a shared treasury across cycles.

> Sage exists to make community knowledge durable, discoverable, and rewarded.
