# Why Now?

AI work moves fast, but community memory is brittle. Great prompts and context live in scattered docs, DMs, and private repos. They decay as models change. There is no portable way for communities to store, version, and improve shared context, and no native path to attribute or reward the people who move the state of the art forward. Sage addresses four blockers:

1.  **Lossy Knowledge**  
    Context is copied and pasted, not curated. There is no global index or version trail that communities can trust.

2.  **Prompt Decay**  
    Models evolve weekly. Yesterdayâ€™s best pattern quietly breaks, and no one sees the diff or the fix land in time. Communities need a place to vote, fork, and ship updates together.

3.  **Zero Attribution by Default**  
    Reuse is the norm, but provenance and revenue share are not. That erodes incentives to publish the good stuff.

4.  **No Community Treasury Loop**  
    Work happens, but there is no clean way to fund curation, pay contributors, and compound gains inside a shared treasury across cycles.

> Sage exists to make community knowledge durable, discoverable, and rewarded.
