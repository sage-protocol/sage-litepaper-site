# Why Now?

AI moves fast; community memory doesn’t. Prompts and context end up in scattered docs, chats, and private repos. As models change, good patterns go stale. There’s no portable way to store, version, and improve shared context, or to credit and reward the people who advance it. Sage solves four problems:

1.  **No Shared Source of Truth**  
    Everyone works from copies; there’s no trusted, up‑to‑date version with history.

2.  **Prompt Decay**  
    Models evolve weekly. Yesterday’s best pattern quietly breaks, and the update doesn’t reach everyone. Communities need a place to vote, fork, and ship updates together.

3.  **No Attribution by Default**  
    Reuse happens without provenance or revenue share, so creators aren’t rewarded.

4.  **No Sustainable Funding Loop**  
    Communities lack an easy way to pool funds, pay contributors, and reinvest wins so improvements compound over time.

> Sage exists to make community knowledge durable, discoverable, and rewarded.
