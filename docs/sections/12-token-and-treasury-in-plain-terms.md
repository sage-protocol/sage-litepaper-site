# Token and Treasury, in Plain Terms

The Sage economy provides three distinct pillars for a self-sustaining ecosystem:

1.  **Treasury Growth:** The protocol's main treasury is funded by a one-time **LBP** launch and ongoing **bond** sales. This ensures the long-term financial health and stability of the `SXXX` token.
2.  **Creator Rewards:** **SubDAOs** receive grants from the main treasury and use those funds to post **bounties**. This creates a direct, work-to-earn loop for prompt engineers and other contributors.
3.  **Community Governance:** `SXXX` token holders stake their tokens in **SubDAOs** to vote on content curation and community decisions, ensuring that the most valuable context is promoted and rewarded.

From the reference tokenomics:

-   **Fixed Supply**: SXXX targets a fixed 1B supply at genesis with deflationary burns tied to creation/forking where appropriate. No inflation.
-   **Treasury Bootstrapping**: A public **LBP** plus optional bond sales seed protocol‑owned liquidity and long‑term reserves; SubDAOs may receive grants.
-   **Coordination over Fees**: Tokens primarily coordinate long‑horizon work (governance, reputation, commitment burns) rather than charging per‑prompt usage.
