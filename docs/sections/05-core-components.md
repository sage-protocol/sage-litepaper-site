# Core Components

-   **On-chain Governance**  
    **SubDAO** Factory, Governor + Timelock, LibraryRegistry, PromptRegistry, and Treasury modules provide the guardrails for how agent instructions evolve- plus optional **LBP** and **Bonding** integrations for liquidity.

-   **Persistent Shared Memory**  
    **IPFS** stores payloads, while subgraph-first reads keep the **CLI**, web app, and **MCP** endpoints aligned on the latest approved manifest.

-   **Tooling for Distributed Intelligence**  
    A full **CLI**, a discovery app, and an **MCP** stdio server (with HTTP mode) connect human editors and automated agents to the same governed knowledge base, orchestrating metaprompting sessions along the way.
