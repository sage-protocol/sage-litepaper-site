# What Makes It Different

-   **Community First**  
    Each community has a **SubDAO** with its own library, governance, and treasury. Forks and remixing are explicit, not implicit. Curation happens in public.

-   **Manifest‑First Upgrades**  
    Ship atomic updates to entire collections. That cuts gas, reduces proposal fatigue, and keeps libraries coherent.

-   **Incentives Built-In**  
    **Boosts** reward participation. **Bounties** pay for new prompts. **Premiums** let creators sell encrypted content with on-chain receipts. Proceeds route to **SubDAO** and protocol treasuries.

-   **AI-Assisted Authoring**: A built-in CLI agent helps you write new prompts from scratch. Use `sage prompt generate` to turn a simple topic into a structured, high-quality prompt file, ready for use and curation.

-   **Agent‑Native Discovery**  
    An **MCP** server exposes search, fetch, and manifest validation. Agents can query libraries directly, then pull the exact context they need.

-   **Production on Base**  
    Contracts, subgraph, and flows run on Base Sepolia today, designed to graduate to Base mainnet following a gated launch sequence.
