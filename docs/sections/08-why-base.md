# Why Base

Base is where on-chain apps have grown fastest this cycle, with significant TVL and a culture of shipping public goods. Aerodrome has become the liquidity hub for Base, with community emissions and LP tooling that many projects model against. Projects launching on Base often use Fjord’s **LBPs** to align distribution with community discovery. Sage follows these patterns for its treasury and launch readiness.

In plain terms: Base keeps fees low, is OP‑Stack compatible, and has the most active community for AI‑adjacent projects today. That means cheaper governance, faster experiments, and better discovery for new libraries.
