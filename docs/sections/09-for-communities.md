# For Communities

-   **AI Artists and Prompt Engineers**  
    Store prompts permanently with **IPFS** CIDs, track versions, and get discovery out of the box. Add premium entries when you want to sell highâ€‘effort sets.

-   **Research Groups and Guilds**  
    Use **Bounties** for new methods, **Boosts** for review cycles, and **SBTs** for reputation. Fork libraries when styles or standards diverge.

-   **Agent Builders**  
    Query the subgraph or **MCP** to pull the latest approved context and keep agents in sync as libraries evolve.
