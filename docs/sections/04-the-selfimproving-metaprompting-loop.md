# The Self‑Improving Metaprompting Loop

1.  **Publish**  
    Authors push a library with a human‑readable manifest. **IPFS** CIDs anchor content.

2.  **Curate**  
    The community proposes variants, votes, and executes upgrades. Approver Councils can be badge‑gated for fast tracks when needed.

3.  **Reward**  
    **Boosts** pay voters or contributors for specific decisions. **Bounties** fund new prompts. **Premiums** monetize high‑effort work. Treasury routes and override guards are set by governance.

4.  **Use and Measure**  
    Agents fetch context via **MCP**. Communities gauge a prompt's value through on-chain signals like forks, bounty completions, and governance proposals, creating a feedback loop for continuous improvement.
