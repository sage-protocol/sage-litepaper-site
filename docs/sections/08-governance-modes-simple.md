# Governance Modes (Simple)

Communities can start simple and evolve their governance shape over time:

-   Bootstrap: member list with proposal cooldowns and refundable deposits to prevent spam.
-   Token: standard ERC20Votes quorum using SXXX or a SubDAO stake token.
-   Operator: trusted multisig or owner executes via Timelock for fast iteration.

The CLI can plan/apply role changes safely through proposals or Safe transactions.
