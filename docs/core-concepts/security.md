# Security and Launch Status

-   **Security Model**  
    All writes flow through a Governor to a Timelock. Emergency pause, least-privilege roles, and upgrade paths are governance-controlled.

-   **Testnet Readiness**  
    Fully working end-to-end on Base Sepolia, including library updates, governance, treasury demos, **MCP**, and the app.

-   **Audits & Reviews**: Contracts follow standard OZ Governor/Timelock patterns; external audits and public review precede mainnet.
-   **Role Boundaries**: Sensitive actions route through the Timelock; council modules can allowlist function selectors for scoped, badge‑gated fast tracks.
-   **Operational Hygiene**: Default timelock delays, proposal cooldowns, and per‑address caps reduce spam and operational risk during bootstrap.
