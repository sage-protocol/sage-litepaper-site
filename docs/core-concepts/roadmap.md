# Roadmap

*   **Completed**
    SubDAO factory, Library and Prompt registries, governance flows, **Boosts**, **Premiums**, **SBTs**, **MCP**, **CLI**, and discovery app are live on Base Sepolia.

*   **Shipping (Phase A)**
    - **Pay-to-Pin Credits**: Cloudflare Worker with Durable Object ledger, checkout webhooks, and CLI UX (`sage ipfs credits`, `buy-credits`).
    - **Prompt Commerce**: Off-chain entitlements that reuse the Personal License + Lit flow while creators fund storage through credits.
    - **LaunchGate Prepare-Only**: Safe payload generation and CLI enforcement of Treasury-only execution paths.

*   **Next (Phase B)**
    - **On-chain Credits**: `CreditToken` (ERCâ€‘1155) + `PaymentRouter` on Base with Permit2 and burn-per-pin semantics.
    - **Unified Doppler SDK**: Viem-based adapter gated by `SAGE_DOPPLER_ALPHA`, plus pricing shim for USDC pools and governance payload tooling.
    - **Personal Library Pointers**: Finalising IPNS + ENS integration for stable, author-controlled library pointers.

*   **Mainnet**
    Execute the launch sequence, wire canonical liquidity (including **Doppler LBP**), and transition ownership entirely to DAO contracts and the Treasury Safe.

*   **Growth**
    First community libraries in creative AI, research, and agent ops, plus grants and **bounties** focused on subjective domains where human curation matters most.
