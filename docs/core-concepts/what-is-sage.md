# What Sage Is

Sage is a governance layer for distributed intelligence, turning community prompt libraries into coordinated agent instructions. Publish once to **IPFS**, register the library on-chain, and let your **SubDAO** steer how agents pull, trust, and evolve that context. A manifest defines the full collection of prompts, and a single proposal upgrades the whole set. Discovery runs through a subgraph and an **MCP** server so agents can search and synchronize without manual glue code. Interfaces include a **CLI**, a web app, and Model Context Protocol (**MCP**) endpoints for agent tooling like Claude Desktop.

-   **Publish**: Push manifests and prompt files to **IPFS**. Immutable CIDs establish the authorized set of agent instructions.
-   **Propose**: Each manifest is one governance proposal in your **SubDAO**. Vote, queue, and execute through a Timelock.
-   **Discover**: Agents, the **CLI**, and the web app read via subgraph first and fall back to RPC for a consistent view.
-   **Use**: **MCP** tools return content by CID so agents can orchestrate tasks with the community-approved version.

This approach turns simple prompt libraries into governed, self-improving agent instructions for communities of AI artists, prompt engineers, and research collectives so they can coordinate agent behavior with clear ownership.
