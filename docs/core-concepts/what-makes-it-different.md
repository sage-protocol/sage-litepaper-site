# What Makes It Different

-   **Community-Governed Intelligence**
    Each community spins up a **DAO** with its own library, treasury, and upgrade cadence. Forks, remixes, and attribution happen in the open, so distributed intelligence stays transparent and aligned.

-   **Personal Libraries & Fast Iteration**  
    Individual creators can publish updates off-chain using stable **IPNS** and **ENS** pointers. This allows for rapid iteration on personal or draft libraries without waiting for formal governance, blending personal ownership with community discovery.

-   **Manifest-First Upgrades**  
    Ship atomic updates to the entire library in one proposal. Governance encodes the bounds, agents inherit the updated instructions, and everyone moves together.

-   **Incentives for Learning**  
    **Boosts**, **Bounties**, and **Premiums** route value to the contributors training the network. Treasuries become self-improving capital that compounds as the distributed intelligence gets better.

-   **Simplified UX**  
    A managed IPFS worker, OS keychain for secrets, and a guided `sage wizard` command streamline the entire user journey from wallet connection to first proposal.

-   **Agent-Native Discovery**  
    The **MCP** server exposes search, fetch, and manifest validation. Agents query Sage like an API, retrieve the approved context, and execute without brittle middleware.

-   **Production-Ready on Base**  
    Contracts, subgraph, and flows run on Base Sepolia today, with a gated path to Base mainnet so communities can scale in a credibly neutral environment.
